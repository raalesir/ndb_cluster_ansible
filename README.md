# ndb_cluster_ansible

The purpose is to test and play with the NDB MySQL cluster installation.

The goal is to make installation as automated as possible with Ansible.

At the moment there are just two VMs (Oracle VirtualBox + Vagrant). 
The first is for the Data Node, and the second is for cluster manager and at the same time for the MySQL server/client.
